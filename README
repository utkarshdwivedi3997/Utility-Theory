A repo containing my Unity project in which I'm researching Utility Theory.
Using two types of enemy "clans," I'm trying to achieve a behaviour from these enemies that can reflect realistic human behaviours.

The main script which handles all the AI is "enemyController_noUI", found in Assets/Scripts folder.
